#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
include the simple multiplications functions.

in all the multiplications
i took the same input variable.
and convert them into float ,so don't work as string while adding or other multiplications.

i also use the , sign to put the variable value directly after string.



#Task 2:a simple greeting with the first name and last name.

i just took 2 different variable with input function to get their first and last name.
and i took the variable c to add the both name together with a space string between them.

i did not change the first to variable into strings because they are already strings value, as i changed in task one into float because the first to variable should be some digit to work our calculations.
